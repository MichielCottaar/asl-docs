TOAST is a pipeline designed to quantify the hemodynamic parameters of Turbo-QUASAR data. Turbo-QUASAR is a PASL based technique that improves the SNR of QUASAR using multiple labelling pulses while preserving the application of crushing gradients and the Look-Locker readout multi-TI acquisition. Each labelling pulse creates a sub-bolus, and the duration of each sub-bolus is equal to the time between each acquisition under optimal blood flow velocity. TOAST uses full Turbo-QUASAR data to produce perfusion in absolute units as well as arterial transit time and ABV images. TOAST also include the option to correct MT effects and estimate the duration of sub-boluses.

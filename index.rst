Basil/Oxford ASL toolbox
========================

``Oxford ASL`` is the name of our ASL processing pipeline. Features include preprocessing, distortion correction, brain extraction, model fitting, partial volume correction and calibration.

``Basil`` is the name of the GUI front-end to the processing pipeline, and is also the name of the code that runs the model fitting part of the pipeline.

The Basil/Oxford ASL toolbox also includes standalone tools for preprocessing, calibration and handling QUASAR and Turbo-QUASAR sequences. The toolbox is available within `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_ (v6.0.1 or later is strongly recommended).

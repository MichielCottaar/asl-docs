Basil/Oxford ASL toolbox
========================

The Basil/Oxford ASL toolbox is a set of tools for processing ASL-MRI data. It is available within `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_ (v6.0.1 or later is strongly recommended).

``Oxford ASL`` is the name of the main ASL processing pipeline. Features include preprocessing, distortion correction, brain extraction, model fitting, partial volume correction and calibration.

``Basil`` is the name of the GUI front-end to the processing pipeline, and is also the name of the code that runs the model fitting part of the pipeline.

The toolbox also includes standalone tools for preprocessing, calibration and handling QUASAR and Turbo-QUASAR sequences.
